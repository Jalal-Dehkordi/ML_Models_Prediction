# Regression Models for Housing Price Prediction

The goal of this project is to predict housing prices using regression models. 

The dataset used is `USA_Housing.csv`.

## Data Cleaning

In this step, we handle missing values (`Nan`) in the features through data cleaning.

## Feature Engineering

- We separate the target variable and dependent variables .

-  Data splitting into train and test sets

## Model Training

We create three regression models:
 Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and fit them to the data.

## Model Evaluation

We visually inspect the predictions of the models using scatter plots. 
Additionally, we evaluate the models based on the following metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
